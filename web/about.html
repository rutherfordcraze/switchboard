        <div class="about">
            <p><a href="http://whoisinthetypemediastudio.today">whoisinthetypemediastudio.today</a> is a project by <a href="https://craze.co.uk" target="_blank">Rutherford Craze</a> for the MA Type and Media course at KABK in The Hague. It is in two parts:</p>
            <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A board of twelve switches (each representing one student) connected to a Raspberry Pi Zero W, which hangs on the wall of the TypeMedia studio.</p>
            <p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A website, which is updated every time the switch configuration changes.</p>
            <p>When each student arrives in the morning, they flip their switch to the ‘on’ position. This is sent to the website, where other students can see who is and isn’t in the studio without having to send a message to the group chat and wait for a reply.</p>
            <p>If you're interested in how the system works, I wrote a <a href="https://craze.co.uk/switchboard+build+log">build log</a> of the project.</p>
